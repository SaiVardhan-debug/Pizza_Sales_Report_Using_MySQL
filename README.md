üçï # **Pizza_Sales_Report_Using_MySQL**

---

üìå **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using MySQL. The goal is to extract business insights from raw sales transactions by writing SQL queries to calculate KPIs, explore sales trends, and identify best- and worst-performing pizzas.  
The analysis provides restaurant managers and stakeholders with valuable information for improving decision-making, optimizing sales strategies, and understanding customer preferences.

‚ùì **Problem Statement**  
Pizza outlets generate large amounts of transactional data daily. However, this raw data often remains underutilized. Managers struggle to answer important business questions such as:  
What is the total revenue and average order value?  
Which pizza category or size is most popular?  
What are the peak sales hours and weekly trends?  
Which pizzas generate the highest and lowest revenue?  
By leveraging SQL, this project converts raw order data into actionable insights.

üéØ **KPIs**
The following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were calculated:  
Total Revenue ‚Üí Sum of all sales (SUM(total_price))  
Average Order Value (AOV) ‚Üí Total revenue √∑ total orders  
Total Pizzas Sold ‚Üí Sum of all quantities ordered  
Total Orders ‚Üí Count of distinct orders  
Average Pizzas per Order ‚Üí Total pizzas sold √∑ total orders

üí° **Key Insights**  
Evening hours showed the highest pizza sales volume.  
Medium-sized pizzas contributed the most to total sales.  
Classic category pizzas were the most popular overall.  
A few premium pizzas generated high revenue despite lower order counts.  
The bottom 5 pizzas revealed underperforming products that could be reconsidered for the menu.

üìù **Conclusion**  
The Pizza Sales Analysis project demonstrated how SQL can be used to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights. By calculating KPIs, exploring sales patterns, and identifying best- and worst-performing pizzas, we gained a deeper understanding of customer preferences and operational performance.

**Key takeaways:**  
Revenue and order trends help in planning resources and promotions.  
Medium and classic pizzas dominated customer preferences.  
Peak sales hours provide insights for staffing and inventory optimization.  
Identifying low-performing pizzas helps refine the menu and reduce waste.  

Overall, this project highlights the importance of data-driven decision making in the food and beverage industry.
